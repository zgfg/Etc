#### HTML Test

How to open an [HTML page](https://github.com/zgfg/Etc/blob/main/Test/test.html) saved on GitHub, from a MarkDown document?

This one opens as a [raw file](https://github.com/zgfg/Etc/raw/main/Test/test.html), as expected.

This also opens as a [raw file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zgfg/Etc/main/Test/test.html).

This [link](https://github.com/zgfg/Etc/main/Test/test.html) or [that](https://github.com/zgfg/Etc/Test/test.html) do not open.
